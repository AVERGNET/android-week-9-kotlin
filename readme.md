Week 9 - Kotlin
===================
### Kotlin MusicSearch assignment:

The goal of this assignment is to introduce the students to Kotlin syntax.

 1. Make all tests pass in the KotlinUnitTest class
 2. Convert the Models class to Kotlin and use data classes for the models
 3. Convert the SongViewHolder class to Kotlin
 4. Add at-least 2 extension methods to the KotlinExtensions file and use them in the code. (Adding an extension to loadUrls to the ImageView class would be a good example of a useful extension)
 5. Experiment with converting other parts of the code to Kotlin if you have time
